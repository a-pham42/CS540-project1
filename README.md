# CS540-project1
Project 1 for CS540

This repository is for Project 1 for CS540.

The goal of this project is to create a single-page application that simulates different CPU scheduling algorithms.
The required scheduling algorithms are:
  - FIFO (first in first out)
  - SJF (shortest job first)
  - STCF (shortest time-to-completion first)
  - RR (round robin)
  - MLFQ (multi-level feedback queue)
