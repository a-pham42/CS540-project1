# CS540-project1
Project 1 for CS540

This repository is for Project 1 for CS540.

The goal of this project is to create a single-page application that simulates different CPU scheduling algorithms.
The required scheduling algorithms are:
  - FIFO (first in first out)
  - SJF (shortest job first)
  - STCF (shortest time-to-completion first)
  - RR (round robin)
  - MLFQ (multi-level feedback queue)

The requirements of this project are:
  - Use `Next.js` or `React.js` to build a single-page application (SPA) 
  - Each algorithm should be implemented as a separate function
  - Processes should be generated randomly
  - The user should be able to set the number of processes and the time quantum (for RR).
  - The user should be able to run each algorithm and see the results.
  - The user should be able to run all algorithms and see the results side by side.
  - Use animation to show the progress of each algorithm.
  - Use `chart.js` to show the results as a bar chart.
  - Save/download the results as a PDF file.
